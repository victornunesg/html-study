# Dictionaries stores name/value pairs or key/value pairs
# You look for a word/key, so you get a definition/value
# It is like a translation table key -> value
# Jan : January
# Feb : February
# Let's define a movie dictionary:

movie = {
    'title': 'Life of Brian',
    'year': 1979,
    'cast': ['John', 'Eric', 'Michael', 'George', 'Terry']
}
# We can actually use any kind of data types
print(movie)
print(movie['title'])  # printing just one item, title
print(movie.get('title'))  # does the same as above
# if you try to get something that does not exist in the dictionary, an error message will be given
# to avoid, we can use the 'get' method
print(movie.get('budget'))  # the results will be an empty object, 'none'
print(movie.get('budget', 'not found'))  # we also can set a default value for non-existent items
print(movie)
print('')

# Updating an item and also defining new ones
movie['title'] = 'The Holy Grail'  # updating an entry individually
# updating all the dictionary with update command:
movie.update({'title': 'The Holy Grail', 'year': 1975, 'cast': ['John', 'Eric', 'Michael', 'George', 'Terry']})
movie['budget'] = 2500  # setting new entry to the dictionary
print(movie)
print('')

# Deleting entries
del movie['year']  # deleting individually
movie.pop('budget')  # using pop, same as lists, releases memory allocation of your code
print(movie)
print('')
print(len(movie))  # checking how many entries we have in the dictionary
print(movie.keys())  # printing the dictionary keys
print(movie.values())  # printing the dictionary values
print(movie.items())  # brings the dictionary in tuples

# Looping into entries in a dictionary
print('')
for key in movie:  # only one item
    print(key)

for key, value in movie.items():
    print(key, value)

# Membership tests
# Dictionaries aren't ordered, can't contain duplicated values (at least the keys)

# Itâ€™s...not really an adventure game...#Ver 1.0
# Your village is being attacked by 'a germanic tribe' and you need to run to the stores and get the right things to
# save your village, and probably some good-looking girl or boy you want to marry. All prices in gold pieces excl. VAT
# The code should allow you to get 1 thing from each store and each item you get should be removed from the store
# inventory, then do same for next store...
# one way to buy by typing the key 'newt' in an input box...or something
# at end you should print the 'items' you have taken, in this version you don't have to pay for stuff or add it up

# ver 1.2 add ability to exit a store without buying and go to next by typing 'exit',
# and to exit if a nonexistent item is bought(typed)
# Add purse with 1000 gold pieces and payment for the items during or at end of code and show a message about
# total cost and how much gold you have left

# ver 1.4 random bug fix, ' browser compatibility', refactoring code... basically being lazy ..stop scrolling TikTok

# Ver 1.5 print inventory before and after purchases as one department_store of stuff(combine inventories from all
# stores into one...pretend Big Biz bought all the local stores, and want constant reporting for inventory management..
# as in all games there is a special way to do this that actually makes money and solves the problem...
# can you find 'them'? Do you know why? May require knowledge of actual python 'lore'
